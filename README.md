# Shopping cart
- You are building a checkout system for a shop which only sells apples and oranges.
- Apples cost 60p
- Oranges cost 25p.
- Build a checkout system which takes a list of items scanned at the till and outputs
the total cost
- For example: [ Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple ] => Â£2.05
- Make reasonable assumptions about the inputs to your solution; for example,
take a list of strings as input

# Simple offers
- The shop decides to introduce two new offers
- Buy one, get one free on Apples
- 3 for the price of 2 on Oranges
- Update your checkout functions accordingly

# Tests
**33 unit tests passing (built via TDD)**
